<H1> Early Life</H1>
<p> I was born in and raised Owls Head Maine where I have lived all of my life. 
My parents are David and Amy Atwood. I have 3 siblings, 2 brothers and 1 sister.
Once I reached middle school, me and my friends would walk to the local Rec center
every day and play basketball. We treated it like our second home, and we all still
go there often.
